## University of Greenwich Networks and Urban Systems Centre (NUSC)

The University of Greenwich Networks and Urban Systems Centre (NUSC) has multi-disciplinary expertise exploring the expanding frontiers of urban challenges and opportunities to improve quality of life, competitiveness and sustainability. With expertise in transport, supply chain and social network systems, we focus on five interlinked strands: production systems; urban ecosystems, business ecosystems, digital business models, and global value chains. We have one of the largest concentrations of business network analysts in Europe, applying the techniques of organisational network analysis to a wide range of business problems, re-conceiving individual firms, organisations and markets as structured relationships.
